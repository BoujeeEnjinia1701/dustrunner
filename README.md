Rail-free crawler robot that uses a rotating microfiber brush to dry-clean panel rows, clamps onto panel edges and docks to recharge.

## Problem

Soiling cuts output of PV arrays in dusty regions by 15 to 25%, and water for washing is scarce.

## Concept

## Documentation

Controlled documents follow the portfolio [documentation standard](.kit/STANDARDS.md). Each carries a document ID (DRN-PRC-001 for the precis), a version and a revision history. Branded PDFs are built with `python .kit/render.py` and attached to GitHub Releases when a document is tagged, for example `DRN-PRC-001/v1.0`.
